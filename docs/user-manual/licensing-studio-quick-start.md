## Tips for Beginners

### ✅ DO This:

1. **Start Simple** - Create 2-3 plans, not 10
2. **Use Clear Names** - "Starter Plan" not "Plan A"
3. **Test First** - Mark plans as inactive while testing
4. **Document** - Write down what each plan includes
5. **Check Analytics** - Review metrics monthly

### ❌ DON'T Do This:

1. **Don't Delete Active Plans** - Churches are using them!
2. **Don't Change Prices Randomly** - Notify customers first
3. **Don't Create Too Many Tiers** - Keep it simple (3-4 max)
4. **Don't Forget to Activate** - Plans won't show up if inactive
5. **Don't Panic** - Most actions can be undone
