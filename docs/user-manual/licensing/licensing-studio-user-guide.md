## Introduction

### What is the Licensing Studio?

The Licensing Studio is StewardTrack's powerful administrative tool that allows you to manage your church management software's licensing system. Think of it as your control center for:

- **Creating pricing plans** (Starter, Professional, Enterprise)
- **Organizing features** into reusable bundles
- **Assigning licenses** to churches (tenants)
- **Monitoring usage** and adoption metrics

### Who Should Use This?

This tool is designed for:
- **Product Owners** - Managing product offerings and pricing
- **System Administrators** - Assigning licenses to churches
- **Business Analysts** - Monitoring adoption and usage trends

### What You'll Need

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- ‚úÖ Admin access to StewardTrack

A **Product Offering** is a subscription plan that you sell to churches. For example:

## Feature Bundles Management

### What is a Feature Bundle?

A **Feature Bundle** is a group of related features that you can assign together. Think of it as a "package" of capabilities.

**Examples:**
- **Foundation Bundle** - Basic features (members, events, giving)
- **Communication Bundle** - Email, SMS, notifications
- **Advanced Reporting** - Analytics, custom reports, exports

### Why Use Feature Bundles?

Instead of assigning features one-by-one, bundles allow you to:
- ‚úÖ Group related features together
- ‚úÖ Reuse the same groups across multiple plans
- ‚úÖ Quickly grant or revoke multiple features at once
- ‚úÖ Keep your licensing organized and maintainable

### Viewing Feature Bundles

1. Click on the **"Feature Bundles"** tab
2. You'll see all existing bundles in a table
3. Each row shows:
   - Bundle name
   - Type (core, add_on, module, custom)
   - Category (foundation, engagement, admin, etc.)
   - Number of features in the bundle
   - Status (Active/Inactive)

### Creating a New Feature Bundle

**Step-by-step guide:**

1. **Click "Create Bundle"**
   - Button in the top-right corner

2. **Fill Out the Bundle Details**

   **Basic Information:**
   - **Name**: Descriptive name for the bundle
     - Example: "Advanced Reporting Bundle"
   - **Code**: Unique identifier (auto-generated)

   - **Description**: What features are included
     - Example: "Custom reports, exports, and analytics dashboards"

   **Classification:**
   - **Type**: Choose the bundle type
     - `core` - Essential features for all plans
     - `add_on` - Optional upgrades
     - `module` - Complete functional modules
     - `custom` - Special purpose bundles

   - **Category**: Functional grouping
     - Options: foundation, engagement, financial, admin, communication, reporting, multi_campus

   **Status:**
   - **Is Active**: Check to make it available for use
   - **Is System**: Check if this is a system-level bundle (cannot be deleted)

3. **Click "Create"**
   - Your bundle is created (empty - you'll add features next)

### Adding Features to a Bundle

After creating a bundle, you need to add features to it:

1. **Find your bundle** in the table

### Bundle Best Practices

‚ùå **DON'T:**

## License Assignments

### What is License Assignment?

**License Assignment** is the process of connecting a church (tenant) to a product offering, which automatically grants them access to the included features.

   - Status (Active/Inactive)

### How License Assignment Works

When you assign a license:

### Assigning a License Manually

## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: How many product offerings should I create?**
A: Start with 3 tiers (Starter, Professional, Enterprise). Add more only if needed. Too many options confuse customers.

**Q: What's the difference between a feature and a bundle?**
A:
- **Feature** - A single capability (e.g., "Member Management")
- **Bundle** - A group of features (e.g., "Foundation Bundle" contains Member Management + Events + Giving)

**Q: Can I change prices after churches sign up?**
A: Yes, but it only affects new signups. Existing customers keep their original price unless you explicitly change their subscription.

**Q: What happens if I delete an offering?**
A: You cannot delete offerings that have active subscribers. You must first migrate those churches to a different plan.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Where is the data stored?**
A: All licensing data is stored in the Supabase database with full encryption and backups.

**Q: Can I export the analytics data?**
A: Export feature is coming soon. For now, you can take screenshots or manually record metrics.

**Q: How often does the system check licenses?**
A: License checks happen in real-time. When a user tries to access a feature, the system immediately verifies their license.

**Q: What if a church exceeds their user limit?**
A: The system prevents new user additions when the limit is reached. Church admin sees an upgrade prompt.

### Billing Questions

**Q: How do I set up payment processing?**
A: Payment integration is configured separately. Contact your system administrator for setup.

**Q: Can churches have free trials?**
A: Yes! Create an offering with `type: trial` and set a trial period duration.

**Q: What about annual vs monthly billing?**
A: You can create separate offerings for each billing cycle or use the "Billing Cycle" option when creating an offering.

### License Assignment Questions

**Q: Can I manually assign licenses to churches?**
A: Yes! Use the "Assign New License" button in the License Assignments tab to open the assignment wizard.

**Q: What happens when I upgrade a church's license?**
A:
- The church is assigned to the new higher-tier offering
- New features from the higher tier are granted immediately
- Existing features are kept
- The change is logged in the assignment history

**Q: What happens when I downgrade a church?**
A:
- The church is assigned to the new lower-tier offering
- Features not in the lower tier are revoked immediately
- Remaining features are kept
- You should add a note explaining the downgrade
- ‚ö†Ô∏è The church will lose access to removed features right away

**Q: Can I see who made changes to a church's license?**
A: Yes! Expand the church's row in the License Assignments tab to view the complete history with timestamps, who made each change, and any notes left.

**Q: Why doesn't the history panel show the initial license assignment?**
A: The history only tracks manual assignments made through the wizard. Automatic assignments during church signup are not included in the history.

**Q: Can I undo a license assignment?**
A: There's no "undo" button, but you can simply assign a different license. Each assignment is tracked in the history, so you can always see what the previous offering was.

**Q: What should I write in the assignment notes?**
A: Include the business reason for the change, such as:
- "New church signup - Professional tier"
- "Requested upgrade for advanced reporting"
- "Promotional trial for 3 months"
- "Downgrade due to payment issues"
- "Migration from old billing system"

**Q: How long does it take for feature changes to take effect?**
A: Immediately! As soon as you confirm the assignment, features are granted/revoked and the church's users can (or cannot) access them right away.

**Q: Can a church have multiple licenses?**
A: No, each church (tenant) can only have one active product offering at a time. Assigning a new license replaces the previous one.
