# StewardTrack Marketing Proposal: Philippines Market Strategy

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** January 2026
**Target Market:** Philippine Churches (All Denominations)

---

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines a comprehensive go-to-market strategy for StewardTrack in the Philippines, targeting churches of all sizes from small congregations (25 members) to mega-churches (1,000+ members). The strategy balances our mission to serve churches with sustainable profitability through a **hybrid pricing model** combining quota-based limits with feature differentiation.

### Key Recommendations

1. **Pricing Model:** Hybrid quota + feature-tiered approach
2. **Freemium Strategy:** Generous free tier to drive adoption (targeting 5-7% conversion)
3. **Regional Pricing:** 40-50% lower than US market rates (PPP-adjusted)
4. **Growth Engine:** Product-led growth with community-led expansion
5. **Payment Infrastructure:** Xendit as unified payment gateway (GCash, PayMaya, cards, bank transfers)
6. **Online Giving Platform:** Enable churches to receive donations through StewardTrack with auto-disbursement

### 1.2 Church Size Distribution (Estimated)

| Size Category | Members | % of Churches | Monthly Budget (est.) |
|--------------|---------|---------------|----------------------|
| Micro | 1-25 | 35% | ₱5,000 - ₱25,000 |
| Small | 26-50 | 25% | ₱25,000 - ₱75,000 |
| Medium-Small | 51-100 | 20% | ₱75,000 - ₱150,000 |
| Medium | 101-200 | 12% | ₱150,000 - ₱400,000 |
| Large | 201-500 | 5% | ₱400,000 - ₱1,000,000 |
| Mega | 500+ | 3% | ₱1,000,000+ |

### 1.3 Digital Adoption Landscape

**Key Statistics:**
- **94 million** GCash registered users (as of 2024)
- **57.4%** of retail transactions are now digital
- **80+ churches** already using PayMaya for cashless donations
- **98%** SMS open rates in the Philippines
- **142 million** cellular mobile connections (122% of population)

**Implications:** Filipino churches are ready for digital transformation. The high mobile wallet and SMS penetration creates fertile ground for church management software adoption.

### 1.4 Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Pricing (USD) | Target | Philippines Presence |
|------------|--------------|--------|---------------------|
| Breeze ChMS | $72/mo flat | Small-Mid | Minimal |
| Tithe.ly | $99-119/mo | All sizes | Minimal |
| Planning Center | $0-200+/mo | Mid-Large | Minimal |
| ChurchTrac | $0-79/mo | Small | Minimal |
| Local Solutions | Varies | Local | Fragmented |

**Opportunity:** No dominant player in the Philippine market. US-based solutions are:
- Too expensive for Philippine purchasing power
- Not localized for Philippine payment systems (GCash, PayMaya)
- Lacking Filipino language support
- Not optimized for Philippine church culture

## Part 2: Pricing Strategy Analysis

### 2.1 Option A: Feature-Tiered Model

**Concept:** Limit features at lower tiers, unlock more features at higher tiers.

| Tier | Features | Price |
|------|----------|-------|
| Free | Basic member directory, attendance | ₱0 |
| Essential | + Giving tracking, basic reports | ₱499/mo |
| Professional | + Budgeting, events, communication | ₱999/mo |
| Enterprise | + Multi-campus, advanced analytics | ₱2,499/mo |

**Pros:**
- Clear value proposition at each tier
- Predictable costs for churches
- Easy to understand upgrade path
- Industry-standard model

**Cons:**
- Small churches may never need advanced features
- Creates artificial barriers to useful tools
- May feel restrictive ("why can't I track giving?")
- Doesn't account for church size

### 2.2 Option B: Quota-Based Model

**Concept:** All features available, limits based on usage quantities.

| Resource | Free | Starter | Growth | Scale |
|----------|------|---------|--------|-------|
| Members | 25 | 100 | 500 | Unlimited |
| Transactions/mo | 50 | 200 | 1,000 | Unlimited |
| SMS/mo | 50 | 200 | 1,000 | 5,000 |
| Email/mo | 100 | 500 | 2,500 | Unlimited |
| Storage | 1GB | 5GB | 25GB | 100GB |
| Price | ₱0 | ₱399/mo | ₱799/mo | ₱1,999/mo |

**Pros:**
- Fair scaling with church size
- All features accessible to everyone
- Natural upgrade trigger as churches grow
- Aligns cost with actual value delivered

**Cons:**
- Unpredictable for churches with variable activity
- May discourage engagement ("don't want to hit limits")
- Complex to track and communicate
- SMS/email costs are real operational expenses

### 2.3 Recommended: Hybrid Model

**Concept:** Combine quota-based scaling with strategic feature differentiation.

This approach:
1. Makes **core features** available to all (members, giving, attendance)
2. Scales **quotas** based on church size/activity
3. Reserves **advanced features** for higher tiers (multi-campus, API, white-label)
4. Includes **fair usage** for communication (SMS/email)

### 4.4 Disbursement Models

**Option A: Pooled Account (Recommended for Launch)**

StewardTrack maintains a master Xendit account. Donations flow into this pooled account and are disbursed to churches on a scheduled basis.

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Simpler onboarding for churches | StewardTrack holds funds temporarily |
| Single integration point | Regulatory considerations |
| Flexible disbursement schedules | Trust requirement from churches |
| Lower per-church setup cost | |

**Disbursement Schedule Options:**
- Weekly (every Monday)
- Bi-weekly (1st and 15th)
- Monthly (end of month)
- On-demand (church-initiated)

**Option B: XenPlatform (Sub-Accounts)**

Each church gets their own Xendit sub-account under StewardTrack's master account. Funds flow directly to church sub-accounts.

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Churches see funds immediately | ₱85/month per active sub-account |
| No fund holding by StewardTrack | More complex onboarding |
| Higher church trust/transparency | Each church needs KYC |
| Direct church control | Higher operational overhead |

**Recommendation:** Start with **Option A (Pooled Account)** for simplicity, offer **Option B** as premium feature for larger churches in higher tiers.

### 4.5 Giving Features by Tier

| Feature | Mananampalataya | Lingkod | Katiwala | Tagapangasiwa |
|---------|----------------|---------|----------|---------------|
| Accept Online Donations | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| GCash/PayMaya/Cards | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Donation Receipts | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Recurring Giving | - | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Giving Statements | - | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Fund Designation | - | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Disbursement Frequency | Monthly | Bi-weekly | Weekly | Daily/On-demand |
| Dedicated Sub-Account | - | - | - | ✓ |
| Custom Giving Page | - | - | ✓ | ✓ |
| Giving Analytics | - | - | ✓ | ✓ |

### 4.6 Revenue from Payment Processing

StewardTrack can generate additional revenue by adding a small margin on payment processing:

| Scenario | Xendit Fee | StewardTrack Margin | Church Pays | StewardTrack Revenue |
|----------|------------|---------------------|-------------|---------------------|
| GCash Donation (₱1,000) | ₱20 (2%) | ₱5 (0.5%) | ₱25 | ₱5 |
| Card Donation (₱1,000) | ₱44 (2.9%+₱15) | ₱5 (0.5%) | ₱49 | ₱5 |
| Disbursement | ₱10 | ₱0 | ₱10 | ₱0 |

**Projected Payment Revenue (Year 3):**
- 1,050 paying churches × ₱50,000 avg monthly giving × 0.5% margin = **₱262,500/month**
- Annual: **₱3,150,000** additional revenue

**Alternative: Pass-Through Pricing**
For competitive advantage, offer payment processing at cost (no margin) and monetize purely through subscription tiers.

### 4.7 Compliance & Trust

**Regulatory:**
- Xendit Philippines Inc is **BSP-supervised** (Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas)
- XenRemit, Inc is also BSP-regulated
- PCI-DSS compliant for card processing

**Church Trust Building:**
- Transparent fee disclosure
- Real-time donation tracking in dashboard
- Automated disbursement receipts
- Clear fund reconciliation reports
- Option for churches to use own Xendit account (Tagapangasiwa tier)

### 4.8 Comparison: Xendit vs Direct Integration

| Factor | Xendit (Recommended) | GCash/PayMaya Direct |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Single Integration | ✓ All methods in one | ✗ Separate integrations |
| Disbursement API | ✓ Built-in | ✗ Manual process |
| Bank Coverage | 94+ banks | Limited |
| Recurring Donations | ✓ Native support | Limited |
| Regulatory | BSP-regulated | BSP-regulated |
| Documentation | Excellent | Varies |
| Religious Org Support | Explicit | Generic |
| Setup Time | < 1 day | 2-4 weeks each |

**Verdict:** Xendit provides a **unified solution** that eliminates the need for multiple payment integrations while providing the disbursement capability to remit funds to church bank accounts automatically.
