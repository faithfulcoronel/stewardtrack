# RBAC UI Module User Stories

The following incremental user stories align with the phased implementation plan for the metadata-driven RBAC UI module.

## Phase A – Foundation Alignment
1. **As a platform admin**, I want to open a consolidated RBAC dashboard blueprint so that I can see a single entry point for managing roles, bundles, bindings, and audits even before data sources are wired.
2. **As a metadata author**, I want to reference canonical role keys from a registry so that tenant overlays remain compatible with future bundle definitions.
3. **As an implementation specialist**, I want inline documentation within the RBAC dashboard metadata so that I can guide church staff through upcoming configuration workflows.

## Phase B – Role & Bundle Management
1. **As a church administrator for a small congregation**, I want a simplified role explorer grid so that I can quickly review which default roles exist without navigating complex filters.
2. **As a multi-campus operations director**, I want to filter permission bundles by scope tags so that I can differentiate global, campus, and ministry-specific access levels.
3. **As an implementation specialist**, I want a guided wizard to assemble permission bundles so that I can compose reusable access templates without writing code.
4. **As a support agent**, I want tooltips and help content embedded in the bundle composer so that I can train new customers efficiently.

## Phase C – Surface Binding Integration
1. **As a platform admin**, I want to view the metadata overlays connected to each permission bundle so that I can confirm what UI surfaces are impacted when access changes.
2. **As a licensing manager**, I want to see feature codes tied to each surface binding so that I can prevent enabling experiences that a tenant has not purchased.
3. **As a metadata author**, I want conditional UI components that react to license status so that tenant experiences automatically hide or show features based on entitlements.

## Phase D – Delegated Consoles & Multi-Role Runtime
1. **As a campus pastor**, I want a delegated RBAC console scoped to my campus so that I can manage volunteer access without viewing data from other campuses.
2. **As a ministry leader**, I want to assign multiple roles to a volunteer simultaneously so that they can fulfill responsibilities across ministries.
3. **As a developer**, I want the metadata evaluation context to process multi-role arrays so that delegated consoles reflect accurate permissions in real time.

## Phase E – Operational Dashboards & Automation
1. **As a compliance officer**, I want an audit timeline showing recent RBAC changes so that I can verify proper oversight during access reviews.
2. **As a platform engineer**, I want visibility into materialized view refresh status so that I can detect and resolve synchronization issues quickly.
3. **As a release manager**, I want to trigger metadata compilation and see publishing progress from the dashboard so that I can coordinate deployments with implementation teams.
